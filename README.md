# Data Science for Music Streaming

We sell our music through [State51](https://state51.com/), and every month they send us an awful, hard-to-comprehend spreadsheet with our sales data in it. So I thought I'd see if I could make it more useful with some Ruby and Docker

## Getting the data

Download the "detail view" spreadsheet, open it in Google Sheets and export it as a CSV, then place it in the `data/` dir with a sensible ISO8801-compliant name (`2019-10-08` or something)

## Building the Docker image

```
make build
```` 

ought to do it

## Running it

Populate the `fields` list in `conf.yaml` with the indeces of the fields you'd like to anaylyse (`8`, `9`, `1` and `24`, which we're using, correspond to `Album Title`, `Track Title`, `Music Service` and `Country of Sale`), then 

```
make analyse
``` 

will attempt to parse the newest file it finds under `data/` and should generate some output like:

```

## Developing it

If you'd like to play with the code (and God knows it needs help) then something like 

```
make run
```

will drop you into a shell from which you can run 

```
ruby analyse.rb /opt/data/2019-10-18.csv
``` 

or similar 

## Running the tests

There are no tests
